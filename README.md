To start, add your env's, for now its not set  up to run like this with env, only on a server. to test it, insert the env's on line 17 & 19 in `main.ts`

Don't forget to install all the dependencies. 

run with `npx ts-node src/main.ts`

in `stuff.ts` [ACTIVE_ADDRESSES] are the addresses its scanning and [BLOCKS] are the blocks its scanning.

Be carefull, MTETH and SWAP made my computer crash, maybe its because of the ETHx2-PLI-P. 

Happy Charting!
